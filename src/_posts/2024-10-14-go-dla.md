## Executive Summary

My son got me interested in
[DLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation) (see
[intro](#intro)).  I made a program to draw some pretty pictures, benchmarked it
(for aggregating 300000 particles on a 1000x1000 canvas), profiled it and
optimised it in 9 different ways to go **from 8min16s to 0.859s**.  Along the way I explored the [Maths](#maths)
about random walks and found useful properties that helped get the program to go
faster.

This long post tells the story of all those optimisations.  I don't think any of
them is amazing, but I found it striking that I could apply so many different
strategies to speed up a seemingly simple program very significantly - in fact
by a factor of 600!  Also I had a lot of fun on this journey and I feel like
sharing it...

## What is diffusion-limited aggregation? {#intro}

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation):

> Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles
> undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form
> aggregates of such particles.

Here is an animation to help understand what that means.  The white squares are
fixed particles and the red ones are in motion.  They follow a Brownian motion,
which is simulated here by a random walk, that is at each moment they are
equally likely to move up, down, left or right.  Whenever a moving particule
finds itself next to a fixed particle, it becomes fixed.  This way a structure
slowly builds.  The process started off with the horizontal line at the bottom
as the "seed".  The video starts some time after that because I don't want it to
be too long!

<p>
<video style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dla-animation.webm" width="500" height="500" controls></video>
</p>

To get an idea of the number of steps required, I display the number of
aggregated particles and the total number of moves made by all the particles at
any moment.  You can see that it takes 100000 moves to aggregate 62 points!  And
this is on a tiny map of 50 by 50 squares.  Imagine the number of moves required
to create the image below, which is 1000 by 1000 pixels, which is 400 times
bigger than the one above.

My son recently told me about DLA and showed me a program he made in Python that
draws nice pictures like the one above.  I thought it was very nice and decided
I would write a similar program in Go.  My aims were as follows.

1. Write it in Go with no with no dependencies apart from displaying graphics.
2. Show progress in real time (otherwise it's less fun).
3. Make it as fast as I reasonably can.

For (1) I've decided to use [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) because I've
used it before and it's very nice in my opinion.  For (3), I'm going to use
[pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof).  I often use it but mostly in the
most basic manner, perhaps this time I can learn some more advanced features!

## Version 1 - the simplest version that works {#v1}

This is how it's going to work.
- There will be an event loop that defines a channel of "pending points".  Each
  frame, the event loop will collect as many pending points as possible without
  dropping the frame rate (60 fps) and add them to the forming image.
- There will be one or more goroutines moving particles about and each time one
  gets stuck to the forming structure, it will send the point on the "pending
  points" channel and start with a new particle.
- There will be a data structure that represents the "world" with all existing
  points on it (and perhaps extra useful data), we will call this the "world
  map".

We need to define some constants, let's put them in constants.go:

```golang
const (
    worldWidth  = 1000
    worldHeight = 1000

    maxPendingPoints = 5000
)
```

I make `worldWidth` and `worldHeight` constants because I expect that they will
be involved in calculations that need to be optimised.  As for
`maxPendingPoints`, I expect I won't have to change it much.  A value of 5000
seems generous, as to fill it you'd have to be able to calculate more than 5000
points every 1/60th of a second...

It will help to have a notion of `Point`, let's put it in point.go:

```golang
type Point struct {
    X, Y int
}

// Move the point by one step (dir is expected to be 0, 1, 2 or 3).
func (p Point) Move(dir int) Point {
    switch dir {
    case 0:
        p.X++
    case 1:
        p.X--
    case 2:
        p.Y++
    default:
        p.Y--
    }
    return p
}

// Clamp to the point to within the confines of the world.
func (p Point) Clamp() Point {
    if p.X < 0 {
        p.X = 0
    } else if p.X >= worldWidth {
        p.X = worldWidth - 1
    }
    if p.Y < 0 {
        p.Y = 0
    } else if p.Y >= worldHeight {
        p.Y = worldHeight - 1
    }
    return p
}

// Translate the point by x and y.
func (p Point) Translate(x, y int) Point {
    return Point{X: p.X + x, Y: p.Y + y}
}
```

The "world map" will also be easier to manipulate if it has its own type.  Let's put it in worldmap.go:

```golang
import "iter"

type WorldMap map[Point]struct{}

// Add p to the map.
func (m WorldMap) Add(p Point) {
    m[p] = struct{}{}
}

// Contains returns true if p was added to the map.
func (m WorldMap) Contains(p Point) bool {
    _, ok := m[p]
    return ok
}

// Neighbours returns true if the map contains a point one step away from p.
func (m WorldMap) Neighbours(p Point) bool {
    return m.Contains(p.Translate(1, 0)) ||
        m.Contains(p.Translate(-1, 0)) ||
        m.Contains(p.Translate(0, 1)) ||
        m.Contains(p.Translate(0, -1))
}

// All iterates over all the points contained in the map.
func (m WorldMap) All() iter.Seq[Point] {
    return func(yield func(Point) bool) {
        for p := range m {
            if !yield(p) {
                return
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Next we need an avent loop to draw the world.  It is a type that implements the
[ebitengine.Game](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2#Game). For
an intro to how that works, see the [Hello,
World!](https://ebitengine.org/en/tour/hello_world.html) example.  Everything
happens in the `Update()` method, which is called every tick (1/60th of a
second).  This methods gets as many points from the channel of pending points as
possible (until in either runs out of points or runs out of time) and draws them
on the world image.

An `AddPoint()` method is also exposed - this is what the workers will call when
one of their moving particles has aggregated.

```golang
import (
    "image/color"
    "iter"
    "log"
    "runtime/pprof"
    "time"

    "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"
)

type Game struct {
    worldImage *ebiten.Image // We draw the world here
    pending    chan Point    // Channel where workers put points to draw
    pointCount int           // Points drawn so far
    maxPoints  int           // Total number of points to draw
    start      time.Time     // When the game started (to log timings)
}

// NewGame returns a new game where the seeds are initialPoints.
func NewGame(initialPoints iter.Seq[Point], maxPoints int) *Game {
    game := &Game{
        worldImage: ebiten.NewImage(worldWidth, worldHeight),
        pending:    make(chan Point, maxPendingPoints),
        maxPoints:  maxPoints,
    }
    for p := range initialPoints {
        game.worldImage.Set(p.X, p.Y, color.White)
    }
    game.start = time.Now()
    return game
}

// Update implements ebitengine.Game.Update().
func (g *Game) Update() error {
    var (
        i  = g.pointCount
        n  = g.maxPoints
        t0 = time.Now()
    )
    if i >= n {
        return nil
    }
    defer func() { g.pointCount = i }()
    for i%100 != 0 || time.Since(t0) < 10*time.Millisecond {
        // ^ i%100 is there so don't call time.Since(t0) too much
        select {
        case p := <-g.pending:
            // Start white and gradually fade out to black
            g.worldImage.Set(
                p.X, p.Y,
                color.Gray16{Y: uint16(0xFFFF * (n - i) / n)},
            )
            i++
            if i%1000 == 0 {
                log.Printf("Points: %d - %s", i, time.Since(g.start))
            }
            if i >= n {
                pprof.StopCPUProfile()
                return nil
            }
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }
    log.Printf("Ran out of time in Update loop after %d points", i-g.pointCount)
    return nil
}

// Draw implements ebitengine.Game.Draw().
func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
    screen.DrawImage(g.worldImage, nil)
}

// Layout implements ebitengine.Game.Layout().
func (g *Game) Layout(outsideWidth, outsideHeight int) (int, int) {
    return worldWidth, worldHeight
}

// AddPoint adds a point to the pending points to draw.
func (g *Game) AddPoint(p Point) {
    g.pending <- p
}
```

All that remains to do is to have a worker that sets points in motion and
detects when they get aggregated.  Let's do it the simplest way we can do it, in
worker.go.  Note that `worldMap` is a pointer, which is not required in our
current implementation but may be useful if we change the `WorldMap` to no
longer be a `map`.

```golang
import (
    "log"

    "math/rand"
)

// AggregatePoints uses pickPoint to choose a starting point, moves it randomly
// until it aggregates, then registers it with addPoint.  It goes forever (or at
// least until it can no longer pick a point not on the map)
func AggregatePoints(
    worldMap *WorldMap,
    pickPoint func() Point,
    addPoint func(Point),
) {
    for {
        p := pickPoint()
        i := 0
        for worldMap.Contains(p) {
            i++
            if i == 100 {
                log.Printf("Stopping")
                return
            }
            p = pickPoint()
        }
        for !worldMap.Neighbours(p) {
            p = p.Move(rand.Intn(4)).Clamp()
        }
        worldMap.Add(p)
        addPoint(p)
    }
}

```

So now we can make this a Go program with a `main()` function putting it all
together and giving us a few initialisation options.  That will go in main.go.

```golang
package main

import (
    "flag"
    "log"
    "math"
    "math/rand"
    "os"
    "runtime/pprof"

    "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"
)

func main() {
    var (
        cpuprofile string
        npoints    int
        methodName string
    )
    flag.StringVar(&cpuprofile, "cpuprofile", "", "write cpu profile to file")
    flag.IntVar(&npoints, "npoints", 300000, "number of points to draw")
    flag.StringVar(&methodName, "method", "circle", "method")
    flag.Parse()

    method := mustFindMethod(methodName)

    if cpuprofile != "" {
        f, err := os.Create(cpuprofile)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
        pprof.StartCPUProfile(f)
        defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()
    }

    worldMap := &WorldMap{}

    method.init(worldMap)

    game := NewGame(worldMap.All(), npoints)

    go AggregatePoints(worldMap, method.pickPoint, game.AddPoint)

    ebiten.SetWindowSize(worldHeight, worldWidth)
    ebiten.SetWindowTitle("Diffraction-limited aggregation")
    if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

func mustFindMethod(name string) methodSpec {
    for _, method := range methods {
        if method.name == name {
            return method
        }
    }
    panic("invalid method")
}

// A few ways
type methodSpec struct {
    name      string          // what to call it on the command line
    init      func(*WorldMap) // function to add seeds to the world map
    pickPoint func() Point    // function to pick a random point
}

var methods = []methodSpec{
    {
        name:      "point",
        init:      DrawHorizontalPoints(1),
        pickPoint: RandomPoint,
    },
    {
        name:      "point2",
        init:      DrawHorizontalPoints(2),
        pickPoint: RandomPoint,
    },
    {
        name:      "circle",
        init:      DrawCircle,
        pickPoint: RandomPointInCircle,
    },
    {
        name:      "hline",
        init:      DrawHorizontalLine,
        pickPoint: RandomPoint,
    },
}

func RandomPointInCircle() Point {
    a := rand.Float64() * math.Pi * 2
    r := math.Sqrt(rand.Float64()) * worldWidth / 2
    return Point{
        X: worldWidth/2 + int(math.Cos(a)*r),
        Y: worldHeight/2 + int(math.Sin(a)*r),
    }
}

func RandomPoint() Point {
    return Point{
        X: rand.Intn(worldWidth),
        Y: rand.Intn(worldHeight),
    }
}

func DrawHorizontalLine(m *WorldMap) {
    for x := 0; x < worldWidth; x++ {
        m.Add(Point{X: x, Y: worldHeight / 2})
    }
}

func DrawHorizontalPoints(nPoints int) func(*WorldMap) {
    return func(m *WorldMap) {
        for i := 1; i <= nPoints; i++ {
            m.Add(Point{X: i * worldWidth / (nPoints + 1), Y: worldHeight / 2})
        }
    }
}

func DrawCircle(m *WorldMap) {
    const N = 2000
    for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
        a := math.Pi * 2 * float64(i) / N
        m.Add(Point{
            X: int(worldWidth / 2 * (1 + math.Cos(a))),
            Y: int(worldHeight / 2 * (1 + math.Sin(a))),
        }.Clamp())
    }
}
```

Let's try it!

```shell
❯ go run . -cpuprofile v1.pprof
2024/10/14 17:26:59 Points: 1000 - 11.427302834s
2024/10/14 17:27:10 Points: 2000 - 22.592300917s
2024/10/14 17:27:20 Points: 3000 - 33.275559625s
2024/10/14 17:27:31 Points: 4000 - 43.320070125s
[...]
2024/10/14 17:35:04 Points: 297000 - 8m16.458362959s
2024/10/14 17:35:04 Points: 298000 - 8m16.475744584s
2024/10/14 17:35:04 Points: 299000 - 8m16.475820375s
2024/10/14 17:35:04 Points: 300000 - 8m16.475883084s
```

It took more than 8 minutes to draw 300000 points, but we get a nice picture in
the end.

Let's see what took so long (I have slightly edited the result to focus on the relevant information).

```shell
 ❯ go tool pprof -http :8000 v1.pprof
Serving web UI on http://localhost:8000
```

[![v1 profiling]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dla-v1-pprof.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 80%"}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dla-v1-pprof.png)

Obviously, using a map to implement `WorldMap` wasn't very judicious.  By the
way, another way to get this information in text form would have been as
follows.

```shell

## Version 2 - Array-backed WorldMap {#v2}

The obvious change to try here is to use a slice or an array as the backing data
structure for `WorldMap`.  Since the dimensions of the world are known at
compile time, let's use an array.  So worldmap.go becomes this:

```golang
package main

import "iter"

type WorldMap [worldWidth * worldHeight]bool

// Add p to the map.
func (m *WorldMap) Add(p Point) {
    if p.X < 0 || p.X >= worldWidth || p.Y < 0 || p.Y >= worldHeight {
        return
    }
    m[p.X*worldHeight+p.Y] = true
}

// Contains returns true if p was added to the map.
func (m *WorldMap) Contains(p Point) bool {
	if p.X < 0 || p.X >= worldWidth || p.Y < 0 || p.Y >= worldHeight {
		return false
	}
	return m[p.X*worldHeight+p.Y]
}

// Neighbours returns true if the map contains a point one step away from p.
func (m *WorldMap) Neighbours(p Point) bool {
    return m.Contains(p.Translate(1, 0)) ||
        m.Contains(p.Translate(-1, 0)) ||
        m.Contains(p.Translate(0, 1)) ||
        m.Contains(p.Translate(0, -1))
}

// All iterates over all the points contained in the map.
func (m *WorldMap) All() iter.Seq[Point] {
    return func(yield func(Point) bool) {
        for i, added := range m {
            if added {
                p := Point{X: i / worldHeight, Y: i % worldHeight}
                if !yield(p) {
                    return
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Let's try it.

```shell
❯ go run . -cpuprofile v2.pprof
2024/10/14 20:14:11 Points: 1000 - 2.131455708s
2024/10/14 20:14:13 Points: 2000 - 4.114867083s
2024/10/14 20:14:15 Points: 3000 - 6.18145s
2024/10/14 20:14:17 Points: 4000 - 8.198248458s
[...]
2024/10/14 20:15:45 Points: 297000 - 1m35.633048875s
2024/10/14 20:15:45 Points: 298000 - 1m35.633134708s
2024/10/14 20:15:45 Points: 299000 - 1m35.633231291s
2024/10/14 20:15:45 Points: 300000 - 1m35.650491083s
```

The result is just as pretty than version 1, we get it 5 times faster!  Wow that
was easy, but let's see what the next bottleneck is (again I have removed
irrelevant nodes from the result).

```shell
❯ go tool pprof -http :8000 v2.pprof
```

[![v1 profiling]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dla-v2-pprof.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 80%"}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dla-v2-pprof.png)

As for version 1, it's even more obvious using the CLI.  Note we can also bring
up a listing of the offending function with some stats about each line.

```shell
❯ go tool pprof v2.pprof
File: go-dla

```

The function is obviously in the hot path, as the main job of the program is to
move a point around until it can be aggregated.  It's already inlined as `pprof`
tells us.  It takes a lot more time than other functions on the hot path (such
as `WorldMap.Contains()` or `WorldMap.Neighbours()`) and it is very simple.
However it has a fair amount of branching (one for each case), and I hear that
modern CPUs don't like branching because it messes with their instruction
pipeline so there may be scope for improvement here.  But before we do that,
there is an obvious thing that modern processors can do well and we haven't
tried yet: parallelism.  I think we should parallelise first, because
- it's likely to bring a very significant speedup; and
- it might turn out that the biggest bottleneck after parallelising is something
  altogether completely different.

## Version 3 - Parallel workers {#v3}

This is going to be an easy adjustment.  Essentially, instead of spawning one
worker goroutine at the start, we will spawn N, N being the number of "cores" in
the processor (to find that out we will use `runtime.GOMAXPROCS()`).

Changes to `AggregatePoints()` in worker.go are limited to adding a new function
parameter `workerNumber int` just so that we can specify which worker is logging
a message.

Changes to `main()` in main.go are just to 
* have a new CLI argument so the number of workers can be adjusted and
* spawn N worker goroutines rather than just one.

This is probably best expressed as a diff:

So version 3 is faster than version 2 by a factor of 7.5!  That's pretty good,
and not very surprising as on my machine I was runnning 10 workers and they were
probably able to each have their own core to work on.  However, there are two
things to note straight away.
1. As the logs show, the `Update()` function wasn't able to consume all
   available points a few times (but mainly towards the end).  It's probably OK
   as the more points are already on the graph, the shorter the path a new
   particle needs to walk before aggregating.  So towards the end the points
   keep coming fast and the event loop needs to stop consuming them from time to
   time to redraw the screen.
2. `WorldMap` is not thread-safe, and is concurrently accessed by all the
   workers.  I think that's OK too, because the only changes to values in the
   array are from `false` to `true`, so the worse that can happen is that a
   worker will add a point on the map when there is already one.  That is
   probably very unlikely anyway, as there are 10 workers (so there are only 10
   particles in motion at one time) and the world has 1000*1000 locations where
   points can be added.

Let's also check the CPU profile to see if `Point.Move()` is still the main
bottleneck as in version 2.

```shell

     5.17s  5.61% 60.61%      5.20s  5.64%  main.Point.Clamp (inline)
(pprof) 
```

In fact the results are very similar to version 2, where all the calculations
happened in a single core.  That makes sense as the timings for each goroutine
are added.  So in version 3, 10 goroutines spent a total time of 26,08s in
`Point.Move()`, and in version 3, one goroutine spent 21.75s in the same
function.  I am not sure what explains the difference (perhaps the fact that
other tasks on my computer also need CPU time!).

So now that we have made sure that we use all the cores on the machine, let's
see if we can optimise this bottleneck.

## Version 4 - Branchless Point.Move() {#v4}

So we have this method

```golang
// Move the point by one step (dir is expected to be 0, 1, 2 or 3).
func (p Point) Move(dir int) Point {
    switch dir {
    case 0:
        p.X++
    case 1:
        p.X--
    case 2:
        p.Y++
    default:
        p.Y--
    }
    return p
}
```

Given how `switch` is implemented in Go, this means there are probably going to
be 3 conditional branches.  Let's try to check that!  There are several ways we
could do it, but since I'm trying to get better at using `pprof` I'm going to
use one of its features.  First of all, as we saw before, `Point.Move()` is
currently inlined in the binary, which makes it a bit harder to locate.  So I'm
going to tell the go compiler not to inline it:

```golang
//go:noline
func (p Point) Move(dir int) Point {
    switch dir {
    ...
```

Then I can make a build of it, run it and examine the CPU profile with `pprof`.
Note that I need to do an explicit build step instead of using `go run .`.  I
think the reason is that with `go run .` the binary gets deleted straight after
the run, so `pprof` is unable to find the symbol table

```shell

```

As expected,  we can see
- 3 conditional jumps: one instance of `CBNZ` (for `case 0`) and two of `BNE`
  (for `case 1` and `case 2`)
- 3 plains jumps, to break out of the first 3 switch cases.

So let's see if `Point.Move(dir int)` can be improved.  It takes `dir` which between 0 and 3, really 2 bits `a` and `b`, which we could write as

```golang
    a := dir & 1
    b := dir >> 1
```

{% katexmm %}
Now let's compute $x = a - b$ and $y = a + b - 1$ for all the values of $a$ and $b$

| $a$ | $b$ | $x = a - b$ | $y = a + b - 1$ | $(p.X + x, p.Y + y)$ |  
|:---:|:---:|:-----------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$         | $-1$            | $(p.X, p.Y - 1)$     |
| $1$ | $0$ | $1$         | $0$             | $(p.X + 1, p.Y)$     |
| $0$ | $1$ | $-1$        | $0$             | $(p.X - 1, p.Y)$     |
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$         | $1$             | $(p.X, p.Y + 1)$     |
{% endkatexmm %}

The last column in the table above shows us that we can move `p` by one step in exactly one direction as follows

```golang
func (p Point) Move(dir int) Point {
	a := dir & 1
	b := dir >> 1
	return Point{
		X: p.X + a - b,
		Y: p.Y + a + b - 1,
	}
}
```

Let's try it (from now on I will not worry about when `Update` runs out of time,
unless it happens too much).

```shell
❯ go run . -cpuprofile v4.pprof
2024/10/14 22:25:17 Worker count: 10

```

This worked really well!  Version 4 is 1.9 times faster than version 3.  Out of
interest, let's see what the new `Point.Move()` method compiles to using pprof
and what time is spent in it compared with v3.  For this, as for v3, I will make
a version of `Point.Move()` with the `//go:noinline` annotation.

That is 1.52s spent *altogether* in `Point.Move`, compare with version 3 that
was 29.53s!  I have heard about the impact of incorrect branch prediction
before, but it seems to me that I'm seeing a probably very simple but striking
example of this phenomenon.  In our case, `dir` is random so the branch
predictor must be completely useless.  Removing the branches altogether seems to
speed up this function by a factor of about 20!

## Version 5 - Stop wasting random numbers {#v5}

Every time we draw a random number to chose a direction for a random walk, that
requires only 2 random bits but we generate 64.  That turns out to be the main
bottleneck at this point.

Coming soon

## Version 6 - Precompute neighbours {#v6}

We now spend most of the time in `Point.Neighbours()`. But what if we could
precompute it?  In all probability it would be done once and used many times.

Coming soon

## Version 7 - Inline function in hot path by splitting it {#v7}

There are no easy pickings anymore.  But one function on the hot path is just
too big to be inlined.  Would be get a significant speedup by splitting it in
two and thus inlining both halves? (the answer is yes).

Coming soon

## Version 8 - Speed up hot path by merging two functions {#v8}

It's getting hard to see what individual functions can be made faster at this
point.  In the previous version, we split a function in two.  This time, we
notice that we execute `p.Move(dir).Clamp()` on the hot path.  Could we merge
these two to make the code more efficient?  (the answer is yes).

Coming soon

## Some combinatorics about random walks {#maths}

At this point I have run out of optimisations, so I consider the mathematics of
random walks, to see if they have properties that may mean we can have a more
efficient algorithm for our problem (the answer is yes!).

Coming soonish

## Version 9 - the final version, from 8 minutes to 0.8 seconds {#v9}

Coming soonish

## A "generic" `graph` package with interfaces

The first non-trivial example of the Go Contract proposal is a [graph
contract](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md#mutually-referencing-type-parameters)
so I am using a similar example. Say we have a `graph` package defining the
following:

```golang
package graph

type N interface {
    Edges() []E
}

type E interface {
    Nodes() (N, N)
}

type Graph struct {
    nodes []N
}

func NewGraph(nodes []N) *Graph {
    return &Graph{nodes: nodes}
}

func Neighbors(n N) []N {
    var neighbors []N
    for _, e := range n.Edges() {
        n1, n2 := e.Nodes()
        if n1 != n {
            neighbors = append(neighbors, n1)
        }
        if n2 != n {
            neighbors = append(neighbors, n2)
        }
    }
    return neighbors
}
```

It is "generic" insofar as it doesn't rely on a particular implementation of the
node `N` interface and the edge `E` interface, but of course as Go currently
stands it suffers from all the problems that the Go generics proposals are
trying to solve. To define these problems more precisely, let's try to use the
package above.

## Issues with the `graph` package

Say we have another package `mygraph` in which we want to implement a graph
using the `graph.Graph` type but with a specialized type for `N` and `E`:

```golang
package mygraph

type Node struct {
    edges []*Edge
}

func (n *Node) Edges []*Edge {
    return n.edges
}

type Edge struct {
    n1, n2 *Node
}

func (e *Edge) Nodes (*Edge, *Edge) {
    return e.n1, e.n2
}
```

If we want to make use of the `graph.Graph` type and the `graph.Neighbors`
functions, many problems arise:

- type safety: the compiler cannot ensure that only instances of `*Node` will be
  in our graph instance, as any type that implements `graph.N` will satisfy the
  type constraints.
- performance: all our instances of `*Node` and `*Edge` will be wrapped in an
  interface, which will incur a small performance penalty. It also follows from
  this that there will be no opportunity for the compiler to optimise the code
  in the `graph` package for the particular `*Node` and `*Edge` implementations
  of the `graph.N` and `graph.E` interfaces.
- boilerplate: it will be necessary to convert between interface and concrete
  type continually in the code using `graph`, and also between slice types, e.g.
  `[]*Node` and `[]graph.N`.

## Specialization as a means to remedy these issues

We introduce the idea of _specialization_. A specialization can be seen as a
mapping from Go package-level identifiers to compile-time defined values (e.g.
types, functions, constants). The new keyword `spec` will allow us to defined
specializations.

```golang
// in package mygraph

spec GraphSpec {
    type N = *Node // The identifier N maps to the *Node type
    type E = *Edge // The identifier E maps to the *Edge type
}
```

This defines the `GraphSpec` specialization. This specialization can then be
_applied_ to package level types, functions, or even whole packages. A
specialization is applied by replacing the definitions of the identifiers named
in it with the value they are defined as in the target package. Here are some
examples, all supposed to be defined in the `mygraph` package.

```golang
// import "graph"

type Graph = GraphSpec(graph.Graph)
```

This is equivalent to defining

```golang
type Graph struct {
    nodes []*Node
}
```

Or:

```golang
func Neighbors = GraphSpec(graph.Neighbors)
```

This is equivalent to defining

```golang
func Neighbors(n Node) []*Node {
    var neighbors []*Node
    for _, e := range n.Edges() {
        n1, n2 := e.Nodes()
        if n1 != n {
            neighbors = append(neighbors, n1)
        }
        if n2 != n {
            neighbors = append(neighbors, n2)
        }
    }
    return neighbors
}
```

Or even perhaps

```golang
GraphSpec(graph)
```

This would be equivalent to "reimplementing" the whole of the `graph` package in
he current `mygraph` package, so we would have the following defined in the
`mygraph` package:

```golang
type Graph struct {
    nodes []Node
}

func NewGraph(nodes []*Node) *Graph {
    // ...
}

func Neighbors(n Node) []Node {
    // ...
}
```

## To be continued!

I'm hoping to have some time to think this trough at some point!  If you think
this is a promising idea, please get in touch with me.
